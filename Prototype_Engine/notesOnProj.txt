Things to think about
	how camera movement works
		//make the forward parrallel to the surface, but allow viewing everywhere
	How to pass in the name of the Shader and deal with all the issues this is giving me
	handle the vectors of wchar_t by having them in a function and use that function to do everything that way we don't save the names <--did and we will see how it goes
	do we want to save the names for use with the maps?? <--probably just a regular std::map
	think about passing in a struct that has all of the different shader types <-- I like this
	think about how to probe for an arbitrary number of files and an arbitrary number of directories
		probably won't do, but this would make it scalable

	Think about loading in mtl files
		materials will change especially if we want deferred rendering
	look into having an array of samplers and controlling them in CManager
	could look into ComPtr

	Added ULONG p to DXCore and to CManager and more
	https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/104138
	
	also, I have a single ref to a sampler when deleting the first material <- doesn't say there is a problem, but be careful

CManager
	maps of everything
		VS, PS, Mat, Mesh
		DS, HS, CS, GS...?????
	using weak pointers in the class, so they don't have references
	using shared pointers everywhere else to create references
	Questions
		forget any content to manage???
		how do shared and weak pointers work???
		what kind of map should I store them in???
